        <h1>What is this?</h1>
        <p>
          After joining the King's20 Accelerator in September 2020, I was really
          interested to see how ~60 people would meet each other for the fist
          time, and interact, in a purely online environment.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the things that I miss from meeting new co-workers and peers in
          a physical space is the{" "}
          <a
            href="https://www.inverse.com/innovation/how-companies-have-optimized-the-humble-office-water-cooler"
            target="_blank"
          >
            "watercooler effect".
          </a>{" "}
          Spontaneous interaction with people you (initially don't know very
          well) is really great at spawning new ideas and collaboration
          opportunities. It can also be a great outlet for just having a chat.
        </p>
        <p>
          I wanted to see if I could throw together a digital version of this
          concept in a weekend or two. The result is this website, for fellow
          K20 members to come and spend a few minutes chatting to others in the
          cohort (if and when they feel like it). The video is powered by{" "}
          <a href="https://daily.co/" target="_blank">
            Daily.co
          </a>
          , and if someone visits this website and nobody else is here, our MS
          Teams chat gets a ping to nudge anyone else that fancies saying hello.
        </p>
        <p>Thanks for stopping by!</p>

          P.S. This is very much a work in progress. It might break or behave in
          unexpected ways. Send me a message if something doesn't work right, or
          you have ideas on how to improve this!
        </p>
        <p>
          P.P.S. If you're interested in reading the code for the watercooler, I
          have made it open source:
        </p>
        <GitHubButton
          onClick={() => window.open("https://github.com/rorz/watercooler")}
        >
          <img src={gitHubLogo} />
          View on GitHub
        </GitHubButton>
      </ModalInner>
      <CloseButton onClick={() => setOpen(false)}>
        <span>X</span>
      </CloseButton>
    </ModalBackground>
  ) : (
    <LinkContainer>
      <LinkText darkMode={darkMode} onClick={() => setOpen(true)}>
        What is this? ðŸ¤”
      </LinkText>
    </LinkContainer>
  );
};
